To create a WPF desk top application, Cick on the file tab, click new, and then a screen will pop up and choose AppWPF .NETFramework to create your project
The first thing is to add your classes for the application, Right Click on the project name, Go to add, New Item, and click on class, name your class.

The need to add any windows for  your application is to Right Click on the project name, Go to add, New Item, and click on Window WPF, name your Name your window.
I created in each xmal file he rows and columns needed for my gui to be placed in with a clean look. Once you are more advance, the recommended thing to use is a stackpanel which is a better formattig for your gui. Label each button to fucntion as you would like, in the .cs file you will program what specified things you want the button to perform such as a new window that you would declare with the word window name, window object= new window name.
